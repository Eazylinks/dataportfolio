							<h2>INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS</h2>
							Through a detailed analysis Using the SQL , the following key insights were derived:
							<ol type "1">
								<li Align="justify">The analysis reveals the total stock levels for each product, allowing the company to monitor inventory availability. Products with low inventory can be flagged for restocking, while those with high inventory might require promotion or discount strategies to avoid overstocking costs.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The results show which products and categories are driving the most revenue across different years. High-performing categories and products should be prioritized for marketing and inventory replenishment. This data also helps identify underperforming areas that might need additional support or reevaluation.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The analysis suggests a correlation between inflation rates and sales volume. Noticing trends where inflation negatively impacts sales can guide the company in adjusting pricing strategies or offering discounts during high inflation periods to maintain customer demand.</li>
								<li Align="justify">Sales quantities across 2021 show how inflation may have influenced customer purchasing behavior. Products that maintained steady sales despite inflation might be more resilient or essential, while those with declining sales may require price adjustments or promotions to counteract inflationary effects.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The insight reveals that promotional activities have a measurable impact on sales quantities. Products with promotions generally see a boost in sales, validating the effectiveness of the company’s promotional strategies. This data can be used to optimize future promotional efforts, focusing on products that respond well to marketing initiatives.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The analysis provides a clear view of which product categories have the highest and lowest average sales quantities. High average sales in specific categories indicate strong customer demand, suggesting these categories should be a focus for stock replenishment and marketing. Conversely, categories with lower averages may need promotional efforts or further market analysis.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The results show how macroeconomic factors like GDP influence sales performance. Higher GDP levels generally correspond to increased sales, suggesting that the company’s performance is positively correlated with economic growth. This insight can be used for long-term strategic planning and adjusting business operations based on economic forecasts.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The analysis identifies the top 10 products generating the most revenue. These products are critical to the company's revenue stream and should be prioritized in inventory management, marketing, and sales strategies. This insight helps focus resources on products that are most profitable.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The results highlight how different seasons affect sales quantities across various product categories. Products that perform well in specific seasons should be stocked up before their peak season, while those that dip may benefit from targeted promotions to boost sales during off-seasons.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The analysis shows how promotions influence average sales quantities across different product categories and products. Categories and products with significant sales increases during promotions should continue to be targeted in marketing campaigns, as they show high responsiveness to promotional activities.</li>
								<li Align="justify">The insight indicates which product categories performed best during the crucial holiday season in December 2022. Categories with strong sales during this period should be the focus of future holiday promotions, while those that underperformed may require different marketing approaches or deeper discounts.</li>
